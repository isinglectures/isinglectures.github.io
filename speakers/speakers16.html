										<h2> Bertrand Berche</h2>
				<h3> IJL, University de Lorraine </h3>
				Bertrand Berche was born on May 6, 1963 in Metz (France). 
				He got his master degrees in physics and in applied physics in 1987 
				from Henri Poincaré University of Nancy, continuing studies at this 
				university as a PhD postgraduate student and defended his doctoral 
				dissertation under the supervisorship of Loїc Turban there in 1991. 
				Since then, he has been working at this university (since 2009 the 
				university became a part of the University of Lorraine). He habilitated 
				in 1997 and became a professor in 1998. In 2008–2011 he was president 
				of the Condensed Matter Section of the National Council of Universities 
				(CNU, France) – a national body in charge of the qualification,
				recruitment and careers of university professors. 
				In 2008-2013 he was Director of the Department of 
				Physics and Mechanics at the University of Lorraine. <br>

										<h2> Reinhard Folk</h2>
				<h3> Johannes Kepler University </h3>
				Reinhard Folk was born on April 29, 1945 in Neuendettelsau, Germany. He studied at Vienna University,
				where in 1973 he has defended his doctoral thesis "Hydrodynamic Equations of Dielectric Crystals" 
				(under advice of Franz Schwabl). In the same year he started working at the Institute for Theoretical
				Physics, Johannes Kepler University in Linz, at first as assistant, and later as associate professor, 
				then as extraordinary professor, and finally as director of the research group "Phase transitions and 
				critical phenomena”. His research interests cover various fields of Condensed Matter Physics. <br>

						<h2> Ralph Kenna</h2>
				<h3> Coventry University</h3>
				
				Professor Ralph Kenna (born 27 August 1964) is an Irish mathematician and theoretical physicist who is deputy 
				director of mathematics research at Coventry University. He is a specialist in critical phenomena and sociophysics.
				Kenna was born in Athlone, County Westmeath, Ireland, on 27 August 1964. He obtained his BSc and Master's degrees 
				at Trinity College Dublin in 1988. 
				He completed his PhD at the University of Graz under Professor Christian Lang in 1993.
				Kenna was an EU Marie Curie Research Fellow at the University of Liverpool (1994–1997) and at 
				Trinity College Dublin (1997–1999). He lectured at Trinity College from 1998 to 2002 and has been with 
				Coventry University since 2012. In 2005, he co-founded the Applied Mathematics Research Centre there.

				His research interests relate to field theory, statistical physics of phase transitions and complex systems.   <br>
